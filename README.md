# Lab 8
We will create dynamic endpoints from the SVM endpoints. Remember this is
focused around using the built in IRIS dataset. If you need a refresher please
look back at the lecture from 4-16-2020.

## 1. How does changing the splitting change the accuracy?.
a) Create dynamic endpoints that change the splitting within the function train_test_split
b) make a table in markdown format that has the results (accuracy) for 60,70,75,80,85,90 % training split

## 2. Create a dynamic endpoint of your choice

Provide the enpoint and a description here:

## 3. Discuss pros, cons and ways forward to this type of implementation
i.e. machine learning flask app, in a container. Think about scaling. 

## 4. Put this in a container
I have done this for you so now answer these questions:

a) What do I need to change in the Dockerfile if I want to enter the shell interactively with the make docker-alli command?

b) What are the benefits of running this in a container ?

c) Explain the make docker-all commands in the makefile
